 Crop Recommendation System Using Machine Learning:
 This project is a "Machine Learning-based Crop Recommendation System" that suggests the most suitable crop to grow based on input conditions like soil nutrients and environmental parameters.

Features:
- Predicts the best crop to grow based on:
- Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium (NPK) levels
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH
- Rainfall
- Trained using a supervised ML algorithm
- Simple web interface built with **Flask**
- Interactive and beginner-friendly

 Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
- Flask
- HTML, CSS (for frontend)

 Install Dependencies:
-pip install -r requirements.txt
-pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn flask joblib
-python app.py
